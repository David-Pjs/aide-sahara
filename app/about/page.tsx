// The About page is the front door for anyone who has not talked to Aide yet,
// a judge, an employer, a curious visitor. It is written as a landing page, not
// a spec sheet: the argument is made through the product's own arc (find work →
// prove it → get hired → get paid), with the honest engineering detail kept for
// ARCHITECTURE.md and the README. Same design language as the rest of Aide,
// Atkinson Hyperlegible, the accessible tokens, the dark transcript-panel band.

        <p className="mt-5 max-w-[60ch] text-lg leading-relaxed text-[var(--ink-soft)]">
          Sign-up forms, dashboards, uploaded CVs, one-time codes texted to a screen. Every one of them is a
          wall if you are blind. The usual answer, a screen reader bolted onto a sighted-first app, is slow and
          brittle, and most brittle exactly where it matters most: money. Aide starts from the other end. The
          conversation <em>is</em> the product; the screen is only an optional mirror for those who can use it.

        </h2>
        <ol className="mt-8 grid gap-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
          <Step n={1} title="Find work">
            Say <em>“find me transcription jobs paying over twelve thousand,”</em> and Aide filters the board
            and reads the matches back to you, then applies on your word.
          </Step>
          <Step n={2} title="Prove your skill">
            A short spoken assessment, an oral question or multiple choice, graded fairly, with the answers
            never revealed. No camera, no lockdown, nothing that would exclude the people this is built for.
          </Step>
          <Step n={3} title="Get hired &amp; onboarded">
            The employer hires by voice, and a private channel opens between you. Your first task and login
            details arrive there and Aide reads each one aloud the moment it lands. No inbox to go navigate.
          </Step>
          <Step n={4} title="Get paid">
            Money arrives in your own real bank account, and Aide announces it the instant it clears. Withdrawals
            go out only after you confirm out loud.
          </Step>

          <Feature title="Real money, never guessed">
            Every balance and every payment is a live API call, re-checked on our own servers before Aide
            will say it out loud. Aide is architecturally forbidden from inventing a number.
          </Feature>
          <Feature title="A code you say, not one you read">
            Withdrawing takes two steps: Aide reads the amount and the bank-verified destination name back to
            you, then you confirm out loud. It is the accessible equivalent of an OTP.
          </Feature>
          <Feature title="Your own bank account">
            Every worker is issued a dedicated virtual account the moment they join, so pay lands directly.
            Nothing to set up by sight, and the account number is the one thing Aide will repeat as often as
            you like.
          </Feature>
          <Feature title="Onboarding that survives the handoff">
            Getting hired usually hands you back to email and chat. Here the first task and the credentials come
            through the same voice channel, read aloud on arrival. The part where the job actually begins.
          </Feature>
          <Feature title="Interrupt any time">
            Talk over Aide whenever you want; the microphone stays open while it speaks. You never pay the tax
            of waiting for a machine to finish a paragraph.
          </Feature>
          <Feature title="Legible for low vision and color blindness">
            For those who do use the screen: Atkinson Hyperlegible type at an 18-pixel base, WCAG-AAA contrast,
            and a colorblind-safe palette where no status is ever signalled by color alone.
          </Feature>

        <p className="mt-4 max-w-[58ch] text-lg text-[var(--ink-soft)]">
          Aide starts listening the moment the page opens. There is no button to find first. Allow the
          microphone and say <em>&ldquo;find me work&rdquo;</em>. If you would rather not speak out loud, there is
          a text box under the circle that does the same thing.
